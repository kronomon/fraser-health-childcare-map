            <h4>Why was this website created?</h4>
            <p>
            When we were searching for childcare facilities for our daughter, we found the process a bit difficult to navigate.
            <ul>
                <li>Some daycares were not easily searchable online</li>
                <li>Google Maps was missing some licensed facilities</li>
                <li>Hard to compare facilities (many were lacking reviews/ratings)</li>
                <li>Fraser Health website hard to navigate when comparing facilities near us</li>
            </ul>
            I built this tool to help us find facilities nearby and easily navigate to the Fraser Health website.
            We hope this website will help other families too!
            </p>
            <h4>How do I use this tool?</h4>
            <p>
            Our process for searching daycares was:
            <ol>
                <li>Look for licensed childcare facilities near us using this map</li>
                <li>Check Fraser Health's inspection info and search Google for more information</li>
                <li>Apply to the facilities we liked</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Unfortunately we can't skip the frustrating process of sending out a bunch of applications and not knowing if/when our child will be accepted ðŸ˜…</p>
            <h4>What does the service type mean? (ex. Multi-age child care)</h4>
            <p>Please review the <a href="https://www.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/family-social-supports/caring-for-young-children/how-to-access-child-care/licensed-unlicensed-child-care">BC government website on different types of Child Care</a>
            </p>
            <h4>How does this tool work?</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Data is pulled from the <a href="https://www.healthspace.ca/Clients/FHA/FHA_Website.nsf/CCFL-Child">Fraser Health Childcare database</a></li>
                <li>Childcare facilities are displayed on a map via <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps">Google Maps API</a> for your viewing pleasure</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The data is periodically updated. Please let me know if you notice any missing facilities</p>
            <h4>Have a question?</h4>
