            <p>
            When we were searching for childcare facilities for our daughter, we found the process a bit difficult to navigate.
            <ul>
                <li>Some daycares were not easily searchable online</li>
                <li>Google Maps was missing some licensed facilities</li>
                <li>Hard to compare facilities (many were lacking reviews/ratings)</li>
                <li>Fraser Health website hard to navigate when comparing facilities near us</li>
            </ul>
            I built this tool to help us find facilities nearby and easily navigate to the Fraser Health website.
            We hope this website will help other families too!
            </p>

            <p>
            Our process for searching daycares was:
            <ol>
                <li>Look for licensed childcare facilities near us using this map</li>
                <li>Check Fraser Health's inspection info and search Google for more information</li>
                <li>Apply to the facilities we liked</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Unfortunately we can't skip the frustrating process of sending out a bunch of applications and not knowing if/when our child will be accepted ðŸ˜…</p>
